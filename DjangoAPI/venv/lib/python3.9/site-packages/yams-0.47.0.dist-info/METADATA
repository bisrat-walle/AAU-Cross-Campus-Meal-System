The python code is verified against *flake8* and formatted with *black*.

* You can run `tox -e black` to check that the files are well formatted.
* You can run `tox -e black-run` to format them if needed.
* You can include the `.hgrc` to your own `.hgrc` to automatically run black
  before each commit/amend. This can be done by writing `%include ../.hgrc` at
  the end of your `.hgrc`.
